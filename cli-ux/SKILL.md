description:
  Design, review, or improve command-line interfaces for strong UX,
  accessibility, composability, and automation. Use when users ask about CLI
  design, command trees, flags, help text, onboarding, errors, streams, exit
  codes, progress output, color, completions, interactive modes, screen-reader
  accessibility, or CLI best practices.

## Use when

- Designing or reviewing a CLI, command tree, subcommand, flag set, or terminal
  output contract.
- Improving onboarding, `--help`, examples, man pages, shell completions, or
  install/discovery flow.
- Making CLI errors actionable with validation, recovery suggestions, and stable
  error codes.
- Balancing human-friendly output with scriptability, `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr`,
  exit codes, and structured formats.
- Auditing accessibility: screen readers, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, non-TTY
  output, animation, tables, ASCII art, or plain modes.

## Avoid when

- The task is a full TUI design rather than command-line utility behavior.
- The user only needs shell scripting internals rather than CLI interface
  behavior.
- Product/domain correctness dominates interface design and no CLI surface is
  being changed.

## Instructions

1. Start from the terminal user journey: install, discover command name,
   tab-complete, run first command, ask for help, then compose/automate.
2. Optimize time-to-value: show likely first commands, concise examples, and
   next steps before exhaustive docs.
3. Provide `-h`/`--help` on the main command and subcommands; keep help fast,
   predictable, searchable, and example-rich.
4. Use familiar names and a consistent command tree so users can guess commands
   from prior commands.
5. Treat CLI arguments as a public API: avoid breaking changes; document
   unstable human output versus stable machine/porcelain output.
6. Validate input early and make errors human-readable: what happened, why,
   likely owner, how to fix, and where to get details.
7. Use streams correctly: data on stdout, diagnostics on stderr, accept stdin
   where useful, and return meaningful exit codes.
8. Keep non-interactive mode first-class. Interactive prompts can guide humans,
   but must not replace flags/config for automation.
9. Make output accessible by default: boring, linear, grepable,
   screen-reader-friendly, and useful when redirected.
10. Gate visual affordances: color only on TTY and never when `NO_COLOR`; no
    animation/spinners when not TTY, `TERM=dumb`, CI, or `--no-animation`.
11. Prefer structured output flags (`--json`, `--yaml`, or stable line formats)
    for parsing and assistive tooling.
12. For destructive operations, include dry-run/preview and explicit
    confirmation controls.

## Progressive disclosure

- Read `references/cli-ux-principles.md` for source-derived design principles
  and tradeoffs.
- Use `evals/trigger-prompts.json` when refining trigger behavior.
- Use `evals/evals.json` when checking CLI UX review quality.

## Output

- CLI UX verdict.
- User journey risks and accessibility risks.
- Recommended command/help/output/error changes.
- Automation contract: streams, exit codes, structured output, non-interactive
  behavior.
- Validation plan: examples, golden output, accessibility/plain-mode checks, and
  backwards-compatibility checks.
