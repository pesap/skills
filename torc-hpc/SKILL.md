description:
  "Run, debug, install, and operate Torc workflows across local, remote-worker,
  and Slurm/HPC modes. Use when users ask how to install the latest Torc
  release, run Torc locally, submit Slurm workflows, configure remote workers,
  use invocation scripts, set `TORC_API_URL`, collect logs/artifacts, debug
  failed runs, run a specific code version remotely from an exact Git
  SHA/worktree, or handle HPC Git/LFS/module issues without rsyncing the whole
  repo."

## Use when

- User wants to run a Torc workflow locally for smoke testing or development.
- User needs to install or refresh the latest Torc release binary before running
  local or remote orchestration commands.
- User wants to detect an HPC profile, inspect partitions, or submit Torc
  workflows to Slurm/HPC with `torc hpc detect`, `torc hpc partitions`,
  `torc slurm generate`, and `torc submit`.
- User wants to use or debug Torc remote workers over SSH.
- User is wiring or debugging `invocation_script` wrappers, modules, conda, or
  `TORC_API_URL`.
- User wants to inspect logs, status, resource data, or failure behavior for
  Torc runs.
- User wants to configure `git push hpc` style code transport through a remote
  bare Git repository for reproducible HPC runs.
- User wants to run a specific branch/tag/commit remotely from a prepared remote
  checkout or per-run worktree.
- User needs cleanup guidance for per-run worktrees or temporary refs after
  versioned remote runs.
- User needs to work around Git LFS, module discovery, or load-balanced HPC
  login entrypoints for Torc runs.

## Avoid when

- Task is generic Slurm guidance with no Torc workflow angle.
- Task is solver/model formulation debugging rather than Torc
  runtime/setup/operations.
- User needs site policy or cluster admin decisions that must come from
  operators.

## Instructions

1. First isolate the Torc mode:
   - local standalone or local server/client
   - remote workers over SSH
   - Slurm/HPC submission
   - manual remote command fallback
   - versioned remote code execution from a prepared remote checkout/worktree
2. Prefer the smallest runnable smoke test before full workloads.
3. Prefer Torc-native flows over ad hoc shell orchestration:
   - local: `torc -s --in-memory run <workflow>` or documented local
     server/client flow
   - remote workers: `torc remote ...`
   - Slurm/HPC: `torc slurm generate ... -o <generated>.yaml` then
     `torc submit <generated>.yaml`
4. Keep site setup in an `invocation_script`, startup script, or job prologue
   instead of embedding environment setup into every command.
5. For remote/tunneled use, verify the correct `TORC_API_URL` and network
   reachability before blaming workflow logic. If the remote/shared Torc server
   is reachable from local `torc`, query workflow status locally; do not SSH
   just to run `torc status`.
6. For reproducible remote runs, code travels by Git commit/ref and data stays
   remote. Use a reachable Git remote such as `hpc`, fetch or materialize the
   exact SHA on the cluster, and require jobs to reference data already present
   on the remote filesystem.
7. Use the site load-balanced login entrypoint when one exists; do not hardcode
   direct login nodes unless the user explicitly asks.
8. Do not run build/solve/smoke workload commands on login nodes. Login-node
   work is limited to lightweight checks, module discovery, Git/worktree
   preparation, Torc binary installation when site policy allows user-managed
   tools, and Torc/Slurm submission. Let Slurm allocations run `uv`, builds, and
   solver work.
9. When Torc is missing and a user-managed binary is appropriate, use
   `scripts/install-latest-torc.sh` to install the latest release from GitHub
   into `TORC_INSTALL_DIR` or `~/.local/bin`.
10. When the user wants `git push hpc` setup, use
    `scripts/setup-hpc-git-remote.sh` to create/reuse the remote bare repo and
    configure the local remote.
11. When the user wants to run a specific code version remotely, use
    `scripts/prepare-git-run.sh` to create an isolated exact-SHA worktree under
    the run directory. Do **not** run jobs from the receiving bare repo or from
    a shared mutable checkout.
12. Treat `scripts/run-remote.sh` as a remote command runner for an existing
    remote workdir, not as a repo-sync mechanism.
13. Use `scripts/push-run-cleanup.sh` when the user wants one local command to
    push HEAD or an explicit SHA to the remote bare repo, create an exact-SHA
    worktree, run a lightweight repo script there, fetch logs/artifacts, and
    clean up the temporary worktree.
14. Use preflight checks before launch; use cleanup helpers only when versioned
    remote runs create temporary worktrees/refs.
15. After failures, inspect Torc-native signals first: workflow/job status,
    logs, results, resource data, then fallback shell diagnostics.
16. Do not rely on shell-style `${VAR:-default}` interpolation inside workflow
    `command` or `env`; prefer concrete values or pre-rendered files before
    submission.
