# PRs and review threads

Check CI status on a PR:

```bash
gh pr checks 55 --repo owner/repo
```

Check whether a branch already has an open PR:

```bash
gh pr list --repo owner/repo --state open --head my-branch \
  --json number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName
```

Create a PR with an explicit body file:

```bash
gh pr create --repo owner/repo \
  --title "chore(ci): reduce duplicate workflow runs" \
  --body-file skills/github/pr-template.md
```

Verify the created/existing PR before claiming success:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --repo owner/repo \
  --json number,title,url,headRefName,baseRefName,body,commits,statusCheckRollup
```

Ship invariants to verify from forge data:

- commit list is exactly the intended commit set (prefer one commit for one
  logical change)
- base branch is the default branch unless the user asked otherwise
- commit signatures are verified on the shipped commit(s)
- PR body is plain markdown/text; do not submit or report raw HTML
- PR body has no unreplaced placeholders such as `Closes {LINK TO GH ISSUE}`
- PR body close text uses the resolved durable source issue number when
  available and never says `Closes: none` or `Closes: non`
- checks are green before reporting ship success

## Reply to reviewer comments in-thread (preferred)

List review comments and IDs:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/55/comments \
  --jq '.[] | {id, in_reply_to_id, user: .user.login, body, path, line, html_url}'
```

Reply directly to a review comment thread:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/55/comments \
  -F in_reply_to=COMMENT_ID \
  -f body='Thanks — addressed in commit abc123 on <file/section>.'
```

Delete mistaken general/standalone replies:

```bash
# General PR comment
gh api -X DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/comments/ISSUE_COMMENT_ID

# PR review comment
gh api -X DELETE repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/REVIEW_COMMENT_ID
```

Use `gh pr comment` only when there is no thread to reply to.

## Policies

- Prefer in-thread replies over loose PR comments.
- Check for an existing open PR for the same head branch before creating a new
  one.
- Use repo-local PR templates when present; otherwise use
  `skills/github/pr-template.md`.
- Resolve the source issue from explicit instruction, issue-numbered branch
  name, session capsule, or forge context before writing close text; omit close
  text if no source issue is resolved.
- Prefer explicit `--body-file` injection over implicit defaults.
